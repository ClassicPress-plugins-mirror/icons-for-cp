# Icons for Canuck CP

## Add shortcode and MCE menu for Canuck CP FontAwesome icons.

This plugin is intended for use with [Canuck CP](https://kevinsspace.ca/canuck-cp-classicpress-theme/).
You can use Canuck CP's icons in your content using a shortcode:
```
[canuckcp-icons icon='paw' size='16' color='#FF0000']
```

It also adds a menu to TinyMCE to choose the icon and insert the shortcode for you.
